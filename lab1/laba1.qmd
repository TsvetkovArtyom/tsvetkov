In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter

```{r}
5+7
```

To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

```{r}
x <- 5 + 7
x
```

Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

```{r}
y <-x-3
y
```
 The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing
| the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called z.

```{r}
z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
z
```
Type ?c and press Enter. This will bring up the help file for the c() function.

```{r}
?c
```

Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.

```{r}
z
```

You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this
| vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

```{r}
c(z, 555, z)
```

Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.

```{r}
z * 2 + 100
```

Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

```{r}
my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)
```

Print the contents of my_sqrt.

```{r}
my_sqrt
```

Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.

```{r}
my_div <- z / my_sqrt
```

Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

```{r}
my_div
```

To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result
| in a new variable.

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
```

Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
```

In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn't work for you, just type the corrected command.

```{r}
z * 2 + 1000
```

You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list of variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy whenyou have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

```{r}
me_div
```

## Workspace and Files

Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using getwd().

```{r}
getwd()
```

List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

```{r}
ls()
```

Assign 9 to x using x <- 9

```{r}
x <- 9
```

Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls()

```{r}
ls()
```

List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir()

```{r}
dir()
```

As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the command ?list.files

```{r}
?list.files
```

Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files()

```{r}
args(list.files)
```

Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir"

```{r}
old.dir <- getwd()
```

Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir"

```{r}
dir.create("testdir")
```

Set your working directory to "testdir" with the setwd() command

```{r}
setwd("testdir")
```

Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R" using the file.create() function

```{r}
file.create("mytest.R")
```

This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let's check this by listing all the files in the current directory

```{r}
list.files()
```

Check to see if "mytest.R" exists in the working directory using the file.exists() function.

```{r}
file.exists("mytest.R")
```

Access information about the file "mytest.R" by using file.info().

```{r}
file.info("mytest.R")
```

Change the name of the file "mytest.R" to "mytest2.R" by using file.rename().

```{r}
file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
```

Make a copy of "mytest2.R" called "mytest3.R" using file.copy().

```{r}
file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
```

Provide the relative path to the file "mytest3.R" by using file.path().

```{r}
file.path("mytest3.R")
```

You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass 'folder1' and 'folder2' as arguments to file.path to make a platform-independent pathname.

```{r}
file.path("folder1", "folder2")
```

Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create . Notice the 'recursive' argument. In order to create nested directories, 'recursive' must be set to TRUE.

```{r}
?dir.create
```
Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command by
| using dir.create() and file.path().

```{r}
dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)
```

Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the
| orginal working directory at the start of these questions.)

```{r}
setwd(old.dir)
```

###Sequences of Numbers

The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:` operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works

```{r}
1:20
```

That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try
| pi:10.

```{r}
pi:10
```

What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

```{r}
15:1
```

Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

```{r}
? ':'
```

The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:` operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.

```{r}
seq(1, 20)
```

 This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let's say that instead we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by
| 0.5. seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.

```{r}
seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
```

Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the
| trick. Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.

```{r}
seq(5, 10, length=30)
```

You're using the same function here, but changing its arguments for different results. Be sure to store the result in a new variable
| called my_seq, like this: my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30).

```{r}
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30)
```

To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.

```{r}
length(my_seq)
```

There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the `:` operator and the length() function like this:
| 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.

```{r}
1:length(my_seq)
```

Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

```{r}
seq(along.with = my_seq)
```

However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type
| seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action

```{r}
seq_along(my_seq)
```

If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

```{r}
rep(0, times = 40)
```

If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

```{r}
rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
```

Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10
| ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).

```{r}
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
```

###Vectors  

First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55, -10, and 6.

```{r}
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
```

Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.

```{r}
tf <- num_vect < 1
```

Print the contents of tf now.

```{r}
tf
```

Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to a new variable.

```{r}
num_vect >= 6
```

Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My", "name", "is". Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double
| quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a variable called my_char.

```{r}
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
```

Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

```{r}
my_char
```

Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You'll see why
| in a second.

```{r}
paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
```

To add (or 'concatenate') your name to the end of my_char, use the c() function like this: c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name
| in double quotes where I've put "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the result in a new variable called my_name.

```{r}
my_name <- c(my_char, "Artyom")
```

Take a look at the contents of my_name.

```{r}
my_name
```

Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together into a single character string. Don't forget to say
| collapse = " "!

```{r}
paste(my_name, collapse = " ")
```

In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!",
| sep = " "), where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements with a single space.

```{r}
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
```

For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the
| character vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep = "" to leave no space between the joined elements.

```{r}
paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
```

Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all
| 26 letters in the English alphabet

```{r}
paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
```
